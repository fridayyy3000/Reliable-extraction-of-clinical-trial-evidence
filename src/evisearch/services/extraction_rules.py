"""Column and trial conventions added to the extraction prompts (option `extraction_rules`).

The same text goes to every system that extracts columns — Agent A, Agent B and the parsed-markdown baseline — so a
comparison between systems measures the architecture, not the instructions. v1 comes from the error analysis of the
first full run (E0) on the development papers, revised after a three-lens review; v2 adds named endpoint subtypes after
v1 was measured on Agent A; v3 adds values stated for every patient and subgroup sizes, from the cells where the
markdown baseline beat EviSearch; v4 drops v3's every-patient bullet after it was measured on Agent A and the baseline.
Schema conventions only, with no paper, trial, drug or value names. `none` reproduces the E0 prompts.

COLUMN AND TRIAL CONVENTIONS (apply to every column):
- The column name says which statistic goes in the cell: "Rate (%)" is a percentage of patients that the paper
  states (give its timepoint; do not compute a rate from counts or medians), "N (%)" is a count and/or its percentage
  (give whichever the paper reports if it gives only one), "(mo)" is a duration in months, "N" is a count. When the
  definition text asks for a different statistic than the column name, follow the column name. If the paper reports
  only a different kind of statistic for the column (for example only a hazard ratio or a median where a Rate (%) is
  asked), answer "Not reported".
- A median that was not reached or is not estimable is a value: write "Not reached" or "Not estimable", never
  "Not reported".
- A per-arm column (its name contains "| Treatment" or "| Control") holds each arm's own value; when several arms fit,
  list each one. Never put a between-arm statistic (hazard ratio, odds ratio, difference, p-value) in a per-arm
  column.
- Total-participant and arm-size counts are the numbers randomised into the population this paper reports on (for
  example only the metastatic patients when the paper analyses that cohort of a larger trial), not a safety,
  per-protocol or evaluable subset of it, unless the column asks for analysed patients.
- Thresholds ("grade 3 or higher", ">=X"): use a total the paper prints for that threshold (a "grade >=3", "grade 3
  or worse" or "grade 3-5" row or sentence) as it is. When one table gives mutually exclusive worst-grade rows, add the
  rows at or above the threshold, grade 5 included. Never add a separately reported fatal or grade 5 count to a
  printed total.
- Add counts only. Never add rows for different event types, and never add or average rates, medians or durations.
- A paper is a follow-up when it reports further, updated, long-term, post hoc or secondary analyses of a trial whose
  primary results were published earlier (for example "as previously reported"), whatever its article type. A post
  hoc table inside the trial's primary report does not make that report a follow-up.
- The add-on treatment is the agent or agents added to the shared backbone in the experimental arm(s), not the
  backbone itself.""",
