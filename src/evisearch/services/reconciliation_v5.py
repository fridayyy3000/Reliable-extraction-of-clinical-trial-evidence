"""The Reconciliation Agent, in two phases: an independent extraction, then an adjudication over three answers.

  phase 1  The columns the two extraction agents disagree on, or both leave empty, are answered from the paper with
           A's and B's answers hidden, so what this stage brings to the decision is a reading of its own rather than
           a preference between two it has already seen. Columns the agents agree on go straight to phase 2.
  phase 2  A's and B's answers are revealed alongside it. The stage decides each column and reports a verdict on
           all three answers, its own included.

What it reads with: Agent B's search (`search_chunks`, whole pages) and `get_pages`, which returns a page's text and
its rendered image, the only way to read a value printed inside a figure or a table captured as a picture.

What verify_attribution is for: a second reader opens the pages a value cites, writes the column's answer itself, and
returns it with the page, the quotation and the modality. Those fields are what the viewer highlights on the PDF. So
the submission gate is provenance, not agreement: a value is admitted once it has been read on its page, and when the
second reading does not reproduce it the value is admitted with the extracting agent's own quotation, marked, and
routed to review rather than dropped (Appendix B of the paper measures the agreement-gated alternative).

An absence is an answer and needs a basis: "Not reported" is admitted when the stage names the pages it read and what
they state instead.

FINDINGS_PROMPT = f"""You extract clinical trial values from a research paper.

You are given columns, each with a definition. Fill every column.

WORKFLOW
1. get_pages([1, 2]) first, and fill what those pages answer.
2. search_chunks with terms from a column's definition for the columns still open. Do not search for what you
   already have.
3. get_pages to read a page in full with its image. Use it for values printed in a figure, a Kaplan-Meier panel, or
   a table captured as a picture: the parsed text often loses those. At most {RECONCILIATION_MAX_PAGE_IMAGES} page
   images per batch, after which get_pages still returns the text.
4. verify_attribution on the values you found, to confirm the page and capture the quote the value will be cited
   with. It reads the page you name and writes the column's answer itself. Use it on values you have already
   located - it is not a way to find them.
5. submit_findings when every column has a value or has been established as not reported.

RULES
- Copy the value as the paper prints it.
- Every column gets either a value with the page it is on, or the list of pages you opened looking for it. Do not
  leave a column unattempted.
- Never write a value the paper does not state. Do not read a number off a curve. Do not compute one unless the
  knowledge notes license that computation; when they do, show the arithmetic and name the row and column of every
  number in it.
- Give the page(s) each value is on and the text or table cell you took it from, copied as printed.
- When the parsed text and the page image disagree, trust the image.
- Search where the answer would be, not only where a word matches: baseline tables for characteristics, results
  tables and figure panels for outcomes, the methods for design, the discussion for durations."""

RECONCILE_PROMPT = f"""You review two independent extractions of the same paper and decide each column's final value.

You have already extracted these columns yourself. For each column you now see your answer and two candidates, A and
B (anonymous), with their reasoning and the pages and evidence they cite.

WORKFLOW
1. Where all three agree, submit that value.
2. Where they differ, read the pages the differing values cite - with get_pages, or with verify_attribution, which
   gives you a second reader's answer for that column from those pages. You have a fresh budget of
   {RECONCILIATION_MAX_PAGE_IMAGES} page images here; the pages you opened earlier are not in this context.
3. Every value you submit must have been through verify_attribution, so the cell ships with the page and the quote a
   reader can check it against.
4. submit_verification with, per column: the final value, which answer it came from, and a verdict on each of the
   three answers.

RULES
- verify_attribution is a second reader confined to the pages you name. Where its answer differs from a claim, that
  is a disagreement for you to settle by looking - not a ruling. Its failure to find a value is not evidence the
  paper omits one.
- Answers compatible at different levels of detail (a drug class and the drug, one endpoint variant and both, a
  count and the same count with its percentage) are merged into the complete value the definition asks for; set
  final_source to "merged".
- "Not reported" is a valid final value when you have read the pages a candidate cites and they do not state one.
  Give absence_basis: the pages you read and what they say instead.
- Judge each of the three answers on its merits - own_verdict, a_verdict, b_verdict, each one of correct,
  incomplete, wrong or no_answer. Your own answer gets the same treatment as the other two."""
