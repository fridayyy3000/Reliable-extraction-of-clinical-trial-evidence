"""
Document reader: answers the reconciler's questions from the whole paper, in a separate model call.

The reconciler never holds the paper in its own context. Its ask_document tool sends questions here; this call gets
the full document exactly as Agent A reads it (every page's parsed text followed by its image, with the same token
budget fallback) and returns, per question, the answer with the page(s) and the text that shows it. The document comes
first in the request, so repeated questions about one paper reuse the cached prefix on vLLM.
