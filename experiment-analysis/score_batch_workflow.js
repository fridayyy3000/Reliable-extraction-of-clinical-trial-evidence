You are scoring clinical-trial table extraction, double blind.

THE RUBRIC IS AUTHORITATIVE AND YOU MUST READ IT FIRST:
  ${WT}/experiment-scripts/scoring/RUBRIC.md
It holds the evaluator_v2 prompts per category (exact_match, numeric_tolerance, structured_text) and conventions
C1-C7, which settle the ambiguous cases. Apply the section matching each item's own "category" field.

The items to judge are in ${FILE}, under "items". Each item has: id, doc, column, category, definition, gold, pred.
Read that file and select only the items for the document named below.

RULES OF THE EXERCISE:
- Judge ONLY gold (GT) against pred, under the rubric. You do not know which system produced a prediction, you must
  not try to infer it, and you must not open the paper or look anything up. The prediction is right or wrong against
  gold, full stop.
- correctness and completeness are each exactly one of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0.
- Apply the conventions exactly. The ones that bite most often: C1 counts must match exactly but percentages have
  tolerance; C3 "Not reached" is a value, not empty; C6 in yes/no columns "No" and empty mean the same thing;
  C7 "count and/or percentage" is satisfied by either alone, "count and percentage" needs both.
- Give one short sentence of reasoning naming the rule you applied.
- Return one entry per item you were given. Do not invent ids and do not skip items.`
