"""Which cells should a human open? Competing triage policies, scored by what they would catch per cell read.

Each policy selects a subset of the 133 columns per paper. For each: how many cells the reviewer opens, how many of
the run's wrong cells are inside that subset (recall), how many opened cells are actually wrong (precision), and the
accuracy the table reaches if every wrong cell opened is corrected.
