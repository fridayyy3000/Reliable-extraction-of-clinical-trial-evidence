"""Appendix B: what the verifier's negative readings did to the table under each admission policy.

  python experiment-analysis/gate_ablation.py <run> [<run> ...]      # two runs of one policy, pooled

A negative reading is a verifier verdict of not_supported or partial. After one, the value read either shipped anyway
or was dropped in favour of another. A dropped value is scored by the rubric labels (keyed on document, column and
value, so a value any stage of the pooled runs proposed has a label), which says whether the drop removed a correct or
an incorrect value; the cell's final score says whether it corrected the cell or made it incorrect.

  dropped            values dropped after a negative reading, % of cells
  of which correct   % of the dropped values that the rubric scores fully correct
  corrected          cells where a partial or not_supported reading dropped an incorrect value and the cell ended correct
  made incorrect     cells where such a reading dropped a correct value and the cell ended incorrect

With no arguments, both policies: agreement-gated (AGREEMENT_GATE_RUNS) and provenance-gated (the system runs).
