"""What a curator can actually check: how many shipped values carry a citation, and how good those citations are.

Accuracy is not the only thing a cell has to be. A value with no page and no quotation cannot be audited, and in
this system it also cannot be highlighted on the PDF - `_resolve_candidate_chunk_ids` returns nothing for a cell
whose attribution list is empty, so the viewer has nowhere to point. Three numbers per run:

  coverage       of the values shipped, the share carrying a page and a quotation
  corroboration  of those, the share a second reading independently arrived at (verdict "supported")
  fidelity       of those, the share whose quoted text is actually present in the cited page's parsed text

Fidelity is a lower bound and deliberately so: a value read out of a page image is often missing from the parsed
text, and is counted here as unconfirmed rather than wrong. The gap between coverage and fidelity is therefore
mostly figures and picture-tables, which is worth reporting as such.

Absences are excluded throughout. "Not reported" has nothing to cite, and counting it as uncited would let a run
improve its coverage by answering less.
